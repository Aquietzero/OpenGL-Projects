# Mandelbrot Set and Julia Set
------------------------------

When I learnt haskell a year ago, I met the beautiful fractal `Mandelbrot Set`. I fully appreciated its beauty in the mathematical video series which called `Dimensions: A walk through mathematics`. Since I am learning OpenGL now, I feel necessary to implement it on my own. The algorithm is not difficult and you can find a bunch of tutorials online.
