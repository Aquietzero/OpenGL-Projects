# My OpenGL Projects
--------------------

Here are my little projects when I study OpenGL. I will keep updating them and consummating them.

## Project List

1. Terrain.
2. Mandelbrot Set and Julia Set.
3. Solor System.

## Library

The directory `lib` contains some of the auxiliary files which implements the functions that I used frequently in my projects.

## TODO

1. Consummating the above projects with my knowledge of OpenGL growing.
2. Particle System.
3. Collision Detection.
4. Sunrise Stimulation.
